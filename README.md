# Bankruptcy Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project builds ML models to predict corporate bankruptcy risk using financial ratios and market indicators. It applies monotonic constraints for interpretability and optimizes models via cross-validation and decision threshold tuning.

## General Outline

* EDA

* Building, testing, and tuning prediction models

* Decision Threshold Tuning

## Applications

* Credit Risk Modeling

* Corporate Default Prediction

* Financial Stability Assessment

## Tech Stack

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost)
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn).

ðŸ“Š Key Results

* Monotonic XGBoost model achieved ~0.932 AUROC.

* Monotonic constraints improved interpretability.

* Threshold tuning reduced false negatives for financial risk applications.
